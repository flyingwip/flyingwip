### Hi, I am Martijn Wip ðŸ‘‹

### About me

 am a Dutch ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡± freelance Web Developer & content creator. I help businesses and start-ups with building out highly efficient web applications using mainly Django & JavaScript.

Back-end and Dev-Ops is where I am the most comfortable and what I enjoy the most! I love to set-up CI/CD pipelines, configure cloud services and servers and I have a big interest in TDD (Test Driven Development).
